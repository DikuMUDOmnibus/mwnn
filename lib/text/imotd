Welcome oh Mighty Immortal!

Remeber, we are here for our players.  Let's keep them happy, okay?
All game policy questions go to Curoehana or Dravin.

READ THE F!@$* MANUAL!  (It will be downloadable on the IMM page. http://homepages.go.com/~curoehana/IMMS)

Have A Good Time!  The game is no fun if we aren't fun!
