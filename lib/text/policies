Policy on M.W.N.N.
------------------

If you have a house and don't pay rent you lose your house!

Spamming of RP, Spells, or Skills will result in *severe* punishment!

The Imm is always right!

The King is the RULER of the RP world.  Dis-obeying a King is just as bad
  as dis-obeying an Imm!
